SaveIt helps find the nearest hospitals and helps saves lives.

About

This project was built during a hackthon in 1 night. This can be expanded to use an even larger hospital data source.

Installation
============
1. Download the project
2. Migrate the databases `rake db:migrate`
3. Manually add the seed data from `dumpfile.sql`. Yeah it's a bit sloppy, well it has been on our TODO list to improve it.
4. Run the rails server
